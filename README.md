# klg_bootswatch

#### An HTML template for KLG (Kewlio Looking Glass) that works with any Bootswatch CSS theme.

* Download and install kgl (https://sourceforge.net/projects/klg/).
* Drop these files into the root folder of kgl.
* Optionally replace the bootstrap css file (also in the root) with any of the themes from https://bootswatch.com/ - one exmaple included already.
* Some font size overrides are done in a <style> block directly in the HTML template.
